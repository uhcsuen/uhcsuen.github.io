I am kind of an enthusiast when it comes to building two things, pc and keyboard. I may not have the most amount of knowledge but it is just really exciting that you can customize and design your own kind of tech stuff. Tech building hobbies has to be one of the more expensive side of hobbies because it requires hundreds to possibly thousands of dollars to make your own. However, the satisfaction level of building something is high for me. You could make both the pc and keyboard glow with your favorite color or just keep it simple. If it is basic and simple, white builds are the way to go.
