If I am not doing homework or studying for school, I will most likely be sitting on my computer or outside. On the computer, I tend to be more around with friends playing games if I get invited. But if I'm not, then YouTube or just watching a video is my way of just relaxing by myself. It seems like I am a big couch potato, but I might exercise for a bit towards the end of the day just to stay on the healthier side. For 99% of the time I am out of the house, I will be eating. I live to eat. It's just something that makes me really happy and helps me relax to spend time with other people (possibly in silence if the food is really good or everyone is just really hungry).
