For WOD#1, it took me about eight minutes because I always kept making a mistake while I was recording my WOD but I could not figure it out during recording sessions. I had to stop the recordings every time because I was thinking that even though I could possibly pass the DNF part of the WOD, I always try to reach for Rx because I feel like it would help me try strive for better times and drill in what I learned from that WOD. WOD#1 took me six times to get down because I had minor syntax errors that I feel like I could not realize until I stopped the timer and took some time to look over everything. WOD#2, I have not seen CSS for almost five years so I forgot a lot about how to do things like setting inline and how to set up and connect a stylesheet. It took me three tries with the best time of little above five minutes. Make sure to review how to get fonts for your text before you start on WOD#2. Lastly, WOD#3, I felt like that was the easiest because there were so little steps to follow, but that was not the case. It was also css like WOD#2, but I recommend how to change the layout of the website where you need to know how to space out each sections and a lane of links.
