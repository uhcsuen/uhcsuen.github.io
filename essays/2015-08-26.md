I took ITM352 because I thought this would be a good start to learn the fundamentals or what the MIS major will be about. I am intimidated by the word "coding" due to past history of high school of my repos not working. I have tried HTML, CSS, Javascript, and C++ but I think C++ has to be my most disliked language because nothing seemed to work out for me. I hope I can maintain a well understanding of the basic language of coding in this class and pray that my coding will work in the end.
