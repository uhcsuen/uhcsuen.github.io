My programming skills have greatly improved in the following ways:
Being able to understand some fundamentals of coding a bit more
Focus on doing one task at once

I need to work on the following to improve my programming skills:
Understand the fundamentals of coding
How to problem solve why a certain task isn't working
Think more simply instead of overthinking the code

I have learned a lot from doing WODs and I can do them without copying the screencast:
Become a bit more proficient with Javascript
How to use JS/CSS in HTML

The labs have help me learn and I am able to complete them with confidence:
Gives me examples on to use it and then be able to incorporate it with new code
New labs incorporating old lab usage helps me understand how to use new and old functions better

I learned a lot from my experience doing Assignment 1 and feel ready to work on Assignment 2:
I learned to not be afraid to ask for assistance from Professor Port
Work on a different task if stuck on something
Start earlier on the assignment

I think the class can be improved to help my learning in the following ways:
Port asks if students have problems with their codes and they screen share their code
Review the part of lab that Port could not finish during class

What helps me the most in class are (WODs, Labs, class website, screencasts, readings, quizzes, one on one help, working with classmates, etc.):
WODs and labs have been the most helpful in class because Port explains how to use functions and etc. during class.
