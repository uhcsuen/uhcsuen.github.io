## Provide a brief introduction to the assignment along with a link to this page for further details
- Code to my page: https://github.com/uhcsuen/ITM352_S22_repo/tree/main/Suen_Carter_Assignment2
- Assignment two was adding a register/login page after purchasing products. The user can either register an account if they do not have an account with the server yet. If they have an account, they can login and look at their invoice.

## What did you learn from this assignment?
- Understand the fundamentals of coding and the purpose of why it is in the code
- Search on Google more for problems and get some ideas
- Work on a problem bit by bit
- If something does not work, work on something else and ask for help later on
- Think more simply instead of overthinking the code

## Did you work with a partner? Assign an estimated percentage on the amount each team member contributed to the assignment (including yourself).
- No, I worked on assignment 2 by myself.

## How did you get help when you needed it? What did you need help with?
- I asked Professor Port when I needed any help because he is the most knowledgeable when it comes to resolving the problems I was having.
- I had a lot of problems that was within the register and login page such as edit registry and removing an unregistered user out of the invoice page.

## How was developing this assignment different than assignment #1?
- I was less afraid of asking Professor Port for help
- I started the assignment a bit earlier than assignment 1 giving me more time to plan what I need help with.

## Estimate the % of time you spent (a) thinking about how to do something, (b) writing code (but do not include testing, (c) testing and debugging
- Thinking about how to do something: 65%
- Writing code: 25%
- Testing and debugging: 10%

## Describe what worked well with this project? What did not work well?
- What worked well for me for this project was setting up the register/login page in server.js and doing things in the server rather than creating different pages.
- What did not work well for me was trying to send data over to a different page because there were so many problems happening one after another.

## If you could go back in time and do things differently, what would you do differently?
- I would still definitely start earlier than I did with assingment 2 because I was working on the project till the very end of the due date.
- Maybe I would try making my register/login pages as html files rather than making them in my server.js to create more login security.
